Helium Core staging tree 0.12.1
===============================



What is Helium?
----------------

Helium is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Helium uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. Helium Core is the name of the open
source software which enables the use of this currency.


License

Helium Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is meant to be stable. Development is normally done in separate branches.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
